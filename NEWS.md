# EpiSODIC 0.5.*

## New

- `episodic_check_cases()` reports all case data problems at once, with row-level detail and fixes
- Lattice suppression collapses one outbreak seen at multiple levels into a single dossier
- Linked clusters show e.g. "Linked to #123" and a Related clusters panel
- `episodic_case_data` documents every column's type, nullability and accepted values
- Deduplication now checks against the most recently stored episode, not just the current batch
- "Isolate" renamed to "positive" throughout the app, reports and validation advice
- New "Frequently asked questions" vignette

## Changed

- Accounts now have exactly two roles: `"epidemiologist"` (read/write) and `"viewer"` (read-only)
- `episodic_validate_cases()` reports all problems in one error, not just the first
- `episodic_run_cron()` checks feeds before writing and stops cleanly on failure
- Status strip and Activity screen show why a run failed
- Farrington now retests every week since the last completed run, capped at 8 weeks
- `config$effect_size_floor` now gates new-cluster candidates against borderline signals
- `episodic_synthetic_cases()` demo data rebalanced to avoid spurious chance clusters
- `lang` now defaults correctly to `EPISODIC_LANGUAGE` everywhere; unset means English
- Empty strings in required columns are now treated as invalid, like `NA`

## Fixed

- Region-level streams no longer report the whole catchment's counts under one region's name
- Cluster line lists no longer include unrelated cases from the same ward or catchment
- Reconciliation no longer opens duplicate dossiers for an ageing cluster
- Translation placeholders no longer break on backslashes
- Epidemic curve thousands separator now follows the language by default

# EpiSODIC 0.4.0

## Changed

- Renamed data interface from "ingestion" to case-based naming (`R/cases*.R`, `episodic_cases_load()`, etc.), no deprecation shims
- Documented data frames/tibbles as normal input; zero-argument functions still accepted
- `care_line` now accepts `NA`, normalised to `"unknown"`
- Corrected `care_line`'s documented values to `first`, `second`, `other`, `unknown`
- A run that skips rows now finishes `partial`, not `success`
- Skipped institution activity rows now warn with counts and unmatched keys
- Denominators and institution activity validated like cases, with clear errors

## New

- Every case column documents type, nullability and permitted values
- Exported `episodic_care_lines`, `episodic_institution_types`, `episodic_sex_codes`
- `episodic_validate_cases()` enforces the full data contract
- `episodic_detection_run` records per-feed supply/dedup/insert/skip counts
- Activity screen shows per-run arrival and skip counts

## Fixed

- Institution activity rows with unmatched keys no longer silently dropped
- Missing translations for `running`/`partial` run statuses added in all languages

# EpiSODIC 0.3.1

## New

- New Pathogen screen: weekly incidence, seasonal comparison, Rt, positivity, age/sex, geography, signals
- MEM thresholds drawn against the season curve with intensity bands
- Rt now estimated per pathogen, not only per cluster
- `mem` detector documented on the Info screen

## Fixed

- `expected`, `excess` and `ratio` now correctly persisted and carried through reconciliation
- Priority score now computes all seven components instead of defaulting most to zero
- Missing components no longer drag the score down
- Doubling time now uses a Poisson fit to daily counts instead of cumulative log-regression
- Positivity now compares region-wide cases and tests over the same week
- Reporting lag now measured from cluster's last case day, not run date
- Rt no longer overestimated for clusters younger than one serial interval
- `episodic_mem_status()` no longer returns ambiguous `NULL` off-season
- MEM now evaluates the last complete week and fits only on full seasons
- Concentration now a share of cases with known postcode, not all cases
- Demographic baseline now excludes the cluster being compared
- Top navigation now correctly highlights the active screen

## Changed

- Choropleth cropped to relevant areas instead of the full reference dataset
- Geography panel now spans the full dossier width
- Standardised terminology to "pathogen" across all languages
- Axis labels and legend text standardised to 11pt secondary grey
- Season overlay stops at the current week instead of running flat to zero
- Dutch terminology standardised to "casus"
- `case_free_days` now translated instead of shown as a raw column name
- Weekly charts now show ISO week number with month/year, thinning past ~18 months
- Cluster ids now shown beside pathogen name in dossier and Pathogen screen
- Pathogen screen's cluster table renamed "Clusters in this period" and links through properly
- Archive now links through and includes a cluster id column
- Top navigation now follows links out of the Pathogen screen
- Pathogen picker's count now labelled as an all-time case count

# EpiSODIC 0.3.0

## New

- Dashboard translated into Spanish, French, German, Mandarin, Hindi and Arabic, alongside Dutch and English
- `EPISODIC_LANGUAGE` sets the default language, falling back to English

# EpiSODIC 0.2.0

## Changed

- Documentation rewritten for an epidemiologist audience
- Internal `episode_` prefix renamed to `episodic_` throughout

## New

- `EPISODIC_DB` accepts a `mysql://` DSN for MariaDB/MySQL
- Package version shown in the app header
- README screenshots now ship in `man/figures/`

# EpiSODIC 0.1.0

First development version.

- Detection: lattice enumeration, five detectors, cluster reconciliation, cross-lattice suppression, baseline feedback
- Interface: bilingual (NL/EN) Shiny app, dossier view, audit-trailed classification, Performance screen
- Reporting: versioned Quarto outbreak reports with small-count suppression
- SQLite backend, with optional `EpiEstim`/`mem`/`quarto`/`sf`
- `episodic_demo()` runs the whole system against bundled synthetic data
